# Air Pollution Calculator
My final year project at Imperial College London as part of my MEng is titled 'Development of a Personal Air Pollution Footprint Calculator'. 
This project partnered with Global Action Plan, an NGO specialising in sustainable behaviour change, Imperial College London and Elsewhen.

## About
This research focuses on developing the methodology to build a calculator which quantifies an individual's contribution to air pollution in the UK. 
There are no official estimates of the average air pollution footprint per person in the UK, hence, this research is the first attempt to estimate an individual's contribution to this issue.<br/>

The Air Pollution Calculator will help the public to better understand the part they can play in tackling air pollution by:
- Giving people the ability to calculate and monitor their personal impactâ€¯on air pollution<br/>
- Providing meaningful guidance for changing habits to cut air pollution<br/>
- Connecting people to the Clean Air Hub, where they can access more in-depth information about air pollution<br/> 

To carry out the research, I created an interactive Excel dashboard to process datasets and present data to stakeholders. 
https://calculator.cleanairhub.org.uk/ is the result of the collaboratively work between ICL and Elsewhen.
